# postgresqlPractice

I made this repo so i can store my training session done with POSTGRESQL. 
I'm learning SQL so i can achieve create better projects with Express and use as i pursue a carreer in Data Analytics. I'm also and Software Engginering student which will take the "Banco de Dados I" in my graduation 

This repo will contain SQL code describing the basic operations to be done with sql and maybe some PYTHON and Express connecting with databases
